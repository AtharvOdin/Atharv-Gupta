        <h2>Job</h2>
        <p>When I grow up, I want to be a Quantum Physicist. I’ve always loved computers, but over the past few years, my fascination with science has grown —especially for physics, which I believe reveals the universe in its raw, untouched form. What draws me to quantum physics is its unique blend of chemistry and physics, connecting microscopic particles to their movements. In my future career, I hope to contribute to cutting-edge research in energy generation, particle interactions, and micro-states. Ultimately, I want to be part of a community that pushes the boundaries of knowledge and understanding.</p>

        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>In college, I want to deepen my understanding of physics and computer science through hands-on research, interdisciplinary exploration, and collaboration with driven peers and mentors. I’m excited to contribute to projects that blend scientific insight with accessible tech, while growing as both a communicator and creator. I hope to build tools that are clear, inclusive, and impactful—and use them to spark learning beyond the classroom. Along the way, I’ll seek leadership, mentorship, and cultural engagement opportunities that stretch my perspective and ground my growth in purpose, fulfillment, and community.</p>

        <h2>Current</h2>
        <p>Right now, I’m fully focused on achieving a 1500+ score on the SAT, maintaining top grades through senior year, and earning 5’s on my AP exams to build a competitive and well-rounded application. I’m actively working on my college essays and preparing submissions that reflect both my academic strengths and personal story, with the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M College Station among my top choices and other great colleges following them.  I’m also committed to finishing the All Star Code program with excellence and earning Scholar status. These goals are a part of a bigger vision to grow, challenge myself, and step into college ready to succed.</p>
