        <p>Hi✌️, I’m Atharv—an avid physics enthusiast who’s always chasing the “why” behind the world around us. Whether it’s grappling with cosmic equations or deciphering the laws of motion, physics sparks a kind of curiosity I never get tired of. Outside the academic grind, I recharge with good stories in books and movies, let creativity flow through my guitar, and dive into gaming with favorites like Rocket League and Fortnite. Life’s a balance of logic and imagination, and I love exploring both.</p>

          </div>
        <p>My father, Anuj Kumar Gupta, and my mother, Sandhya Tripathi Gupta, are the foundation of my life. I’m incredibly lucky to have a family that surrounds me with love, support, and encouragement every step of the way. Whether I’m facing challenges or celebrating achievements, they’re always there—with advice, patience, and unwavering faith in me. Their presence motivates me to grow, pushes me to keep striving, and reminds me of what truly matters.</p>
